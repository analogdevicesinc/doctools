Companion scripts
=================

This path contains some auxiliary methods to simplifying working with the CI.

They are:

* container-run (cr): mount volumes and run commands inside `podman <https://github.com/containers/podman>`__ (or docker) containers.
* act-report (actr): filter `act <https://github.com/nektos/act/>`__ output to only warnings and errors.
