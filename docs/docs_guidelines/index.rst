Documentation guidelines
========================

A brief set-of-rules for the documentation.

.. note::
   The old wiki uses `dokuwiki <https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki>`_. When
   importing text from there, consider the automated options that are provided
   in this page to convert it to reST.

Importing from DokuWiki to Sphinx
---------------------------------

Use the following command to import a DokuWiki page (old *wiki.analog.com*):

.. code:: bash

   pandoc imported.txt -f dokuwiki -t rst --columns=80 -s -o imported.rst --list-tables

The :code:`list-tables` parameter requires *pandoc-types* >= 1.23, included in any
recent `pandoc release <https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases>`__;
if it is not an option, you shall remove it and export in the *grid* table
format (see :ref:`tables` for more information).

After converting, update it to better conform with the guidelines below, and
make sure to use our directives and roles, for example, the :ref:`role git`.

To speed thing up, combine with wget:

.. code:: bash

   wikifile=resources/eval/user-guides/adrv9009/adrv9009
   outfile=output.rst

   wget -O - https://wiki.analog.com/$wikifile?do=export_raw --no-verbose | \
     pandoc -f dokuwiki -t rst --columns=80 -s -o $outfile --list-tables

Also, consider recording macros in your favorite text editor to automate
repetitive steps.

There is also the
`DokuWiki to Sphinx (bash.sh) <https://gist.github.com/gastmaier/9d9c8281dc3c8551991a857cdb2692cc>`__
to further help importing.

Indentation
-----------

Directives are indented with 3 space, which is Sphinx's default.
At code directives, the code keeps its original indentation (e.g. 2 spaces for
Verilog code), but is offset by 3 spaces at the beginning of every line, to
instruct Sphinx the beginning and end of the code directive.

Table of contents
-----------------

The relation between pages are created with the ``toctree`` directive,
which allows to generate the table of contents and navigation bars.

Each page may have only one toctree, since they are the equivalent of the
volumes of a book, and it does not make sense to have multiple "volumes" at
the repository level.

The only exception is the :git-documentation:`/`, which indeed contains various
types of documentation (eval-boards, university program, Linux drivers, etc.).

The ``toctree`` directive has the following format:

.. code:: rst

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: <depth>

      Custom title <path/to/page>

For pages with shorter titles, such as libraries, the label is inherited from
the page itself, for example:

.. code:: rst

   .. toctree::

      library/axi_dmac/index
      library/spi_engine/index

And for pages with long titles, such as projects, overwrite the full title with
a custom title, e.g:

.. code:: rst

   .. toctree::

      AD7616-SDZ <projects/ad7616_sdz/index>

This way, only "AD7616-SDZ" will be displayed in the page navigation bar instead
of "AD7616-SDZ HDL project".

Also, it is recommended to wrap the toctree in a "Contents" section:

.. code:: rst

   Contents
   ========

   .. toctree::

      some_page

For extensive documentation with different topics, it makes sense to filter
the toctree based on the current topic/toctree title.
This is possible by setting the environment variable ``ADOC_FILTER_TOCTREE`` to
``1``.
Alternatively, setting ``filter_toctree`` on ``conf.py`` has higher precedence
than ``ADOC_FILTER_TOCTREE``.
And is supposed to be used alongside the ``topic`` field at ``lut.py`` to
preserve high level links for each topic.

Enable this environment variable only on the release build, since writing pages
with it enabled may be obnoxious and confusing prior the final structure/location
of them.

.. _version:

Versioning
----------

To avoid having the version set in multiple places or having to tweak ``conf.py``
to obtain it from somewhere else, continuous integration can set the environment
variable ``ADOC_DOC_VERSION`` to set the version value.

The ``version`` value on ``conf.py`` has lower precedence, and
will be overwritten if ``ADOC_DOC_VERSION`` is set.

The CI, in general, should set ``ADOC_DOC_VERSION`` as the current checkout branch
in the pipeline (e.g. ``main``, ``v1.0.0``), for GiHub Actions, that can be
``${{ github.ref_name}}`` [#f1]_.

.. tip::

   If creating a branch or PR output, consider using GitHub short reference
   ``${{ github.ref_name }}``.

If both environment variable and ``version`` on ``conf.py`` are unset, it defaults
to an empty string.

.. [#f1] Quick cheatsheet for ``gihtub.ref_name`` values on event:

         * push branch: ``main``, ``dev``, ...
         * push tag: ``v2.2.2``, ``new-feature``, ...
         * pull_request: ``1234/merge``, ``23/merge``, ...

Exporting to PDF
----------------

The whole documentation can be exported to a PDF document for a more compact
format using either rs2pdf or WeasyPrint.
This is done by setting the environment variable called
``ADOC_MEDIA_PRINT`` (the value does not matter) and building the documentation.

For rst2pdf, add ``rst2pdf`` to *conf.py* ``extensions`` list,
install ``rst2pdf``, ``svglib`` (svg support) and ``matplotlib`` (LaTeX formulas)
from pip and use:

.. shell::

   ~/some_repository/docs
   sphinx-build -b pdf . _build/pdfbuild

In the output folder, youâ€™ll find a PDF document named after the repository
(e.g. Doctools.pdf). This document includes an auto-generated cover, followed by
the remaining pages. Note that an HTML build of the documentation is not
required for the PDF build.

.. warning::

   The enviroment variable ``ADOC_MEDIA_PRINT`` should be unset when building
   the HTML pages of documentation. If not set, some components of the pages
   may not render properly.

For  WeasyPrint,
install ``weasyprint``, and ``matplotlib`` (LaTeX formulas) from pip
and use with :ref:`serve`:

.. shell::

   ~/some_repository/docs
   $adoc serve --directory . --builder pdf

The advantage of WeasyPrint is that the design styles (CSS stylesheet) is
respected.

Inner working
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Internally, ``ADOC_MEDIA_PRINT`` variable is set to ``app.config.media_print``
and should be used in scenarios where it is explicitly needed to compile the
content in a different manner than for the **hosted** html.
For example, to render content during build that would instead be rendered with
third-party JavaScript libraries in the user browser.

Still, another approach is to patch the generated html, like is done at
:git-doctools:`adi_doctools/cli/aux_print.py` for :ref:`serve` and
:ref:`custom-doc` with pdf builders.

.. _local_refs:

Local references
----------------

References to labels have the format :code:`:ref:\`context topic\``, e.g.
:code:`:ref:\`role git\`` renders as :ref:`role git`.

Labels are created for any content with the syntax
(dot-dot underscore<label>two-dots):

.. code:: rst

   .. _context topic:

.. hint::

   Add labels to any content that may be linked, locally or
   :ref:`externally <inter-refs>`.

References to docs have the format :code:`:doc:\`path/to/doc\``, e.g.
:code:`:doc:\`docs_guidelines\`` for *docs_guidelines.rst*.

.. attention::

   Do not break reference roles between lines!
   Even though Sphinx allows breaking line inside the reference role,
   it makes pattern matching hard.

Prefer hyphen separation ``-`` over undeline ``_`` for the "title" section,
and always lower case,
for example
``my_code control-interface`` instead of ``MY_CODE Control_Interface``.

Numbered references
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

References can be numbered by using
`numref <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/referencing.html#role-numref>`__,
for example, "*see Figure 1*".

To use this feature, enable on the *conf.py*:

.. code-block:: python

   numfig = True

To customize the format, set ``numfig_format``:

.. code-block:: python

   numfig_format = {'figure': 'Figure %s',
                    'table': 'Table %s',
                    'code-block': 'Listing %s',
                    'section': 'Section %s'}

.. tip::

   By default enumeration is global, so if the toctree is not
   `numbered <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-option-toctree-numbered>`__ to divide the pages in numbered sections (e.g. *Figure 3.4.4*),
   the numbering will "propagate" across page which may be counter-intuitive.

   To have the numbering reset at every page, add ``numfig_per_doc = True`` to
   *conf.py*.

.. _inter-refs:

External references
-------------------

External references to other Sphinx documentation are created using the built-in
``sphinx.ext.intersphinx`` extension.

To setup **in-organization** references read the :ref:`section below <in-org-ref>`,
and for **third-party** docs, the section :ref:`that follows <out-org-ref>`.

| For either, to create a reference to a **label**, use:
| :code:`:external+inv:ref:\`label\``, where ``inv`` is a mapped source,
  for example, :code:`:external+hdl:ref:\`spi_engine control-interface\``.

| To create a reference to a **doc**, use:
| :code:`:external+inv:doc:\`label\``, where ``inv`` is a mapped source,
  for example, :code:`:external+hdl:doc:\`library/spi_engine/index\``.

As the other roles, it is possible to customize the text, e.g.
:code:`:external+hdl:ref:\`Custom text <spi_engine control-interface>\``.

.. tip::

    Pay attention to the log output, since
    a warnings is thrown for each reference not found.

External references work with any kind of references, such as
*ref*, *doc*, *envvar*, *token*, *term*, *numref* and *keyword*.

| For references to **labels** it is possible to use the short form:
| :code:`:ref-inv:\`label\`` (equivalent to :code:`:external+inv:ref:\`label\``),
  but is discouraged.

.. note::

   Sphinx 8 allows the syntax :code:`:ref:\`<inv>:label\``,
   which allows local references to have higher precedence than external
   refs, useful for generating custom docs like user guides.
   However, since some users may require Sphinx 7, use the former syntax,
   and let :ref:`adoc <cli>` patch it when necessary.

To show all links of an InterSphinx mapping file, use the built-in tool:

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/hdl/objects.inv

.. _in-org-ref:

In organization reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create references to Sphinx docs inside the organization add the repositories
of interest to the `conf.py` file with the following format:

.. code:: python

   interref_repos = [external...]

For example:

.. code:: python

   interref_repos = ['hdl', 'no-OS', 'pyadi-iio/main']

Notice that in the example ``main`` suffixes ``pyadi-iio``, this means that will
look for the build at path ``main`` of this repo instead of at root.
This can be used to target a specific version, if the target repository stores
multiple, for example, ``v1.1``, more about that :ref:`ci-versioned`.

.. tip::

   For even more freedom, you can setup with an explicit path as
   an :ref:`out-org-ref`.

It is possible to customize the target URL with the ``interref_uri`` config or
``ADOC_INTERREF_URI`` environment variables.
The default value is *https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/* and can be set to a
local path like *../../*.

Beyond the main target dictated by *interref_uri*,
by setting the config ``interref_local`` as true, a secondary target is inferred
foreseeing a local copy of the target external documentation alongside the
current repository:

.. code::

   /data/work
   â”œâ”€my-repo-0/doc/sources
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€my-repo-1/docs
   â”‚
   â””â”€my-repo-2/doc

The correct relative paths are resolved looking into the ``lut.py``.

.. _out-org-ref:

Outside organization Sphinx reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create references to third-party Sphinx documentations, add the mappings to
to the `conf.py` file with the following format:

.. code:: python

   intersphinx_mapping = {
       '<name>': ('<path/to/external>', None)
   }

For example:

.. code:: python

   intersphinx_mapping = {
       'sphinx': ('https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master', None)
   }

Text width
----------

Each line must be less than 80 columns wide.
You can use the :code:`fold` command to break the lines of the imported text
while respecting word-breaks:

.. code:: bash

   cat imported.txt | fold -sw 80 > imported.rst

The header divider "``---``" shall be either 80 characters wide or end at the
title character, that means, this is also valid:

.. code::

   My title
   ========

.. _tables:

Tables
------

Prefer
`list-tables <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#list-table>`__
and imported
`csv-tables <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#csv-table-1>`__
(using the file option), because they are faster to create, easier to maintain
and the 80 column-width rule can be respected with list-tables.

Only use
`grid tables <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#tables>`__
if strictly necessary, since they are hard to update.

To tune styling, the following classes are available:

* *bold-header*: Make the header bold.
* *bold-first-column*: Make the first column bold.

Lists
-----

Unordered lists use ``*`` or ``-`` and ordered lists ``#.``.

Child items must be aligned with the first letter of the parent item, that means,
2 spaces for unordered list and 3 spaces for ordered lists, for example:

.. code-block:: rst

   #. Parent ordered item.

      * Child unordeded item.

        #. Child ordered item.
        #. Child ordered item.

Renders as:

#. Parent numbered item.

   * Child unordered item.

     #. Child ordered item.
     #. Child ordered item.

Code
----

Prefer
`code-blocks <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-code-block>`_
to
`code <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#code>`_
directives, because code-blocks have more options, such as showing line numbers
and emphasizing lines.

For example,

.. code:: rst

   .. code-block:: python
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 2

      def hello_world():
          string = "Hello world"
          print(string)

Renders as

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   def hello_world():
       string = "Hello world"
       print(string)

Images
------

Prefer the SVG format for images, and save it as *Optimized SVG* in
`inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`_ to use less space.

Store them in a hierarchically, do not use ``images`` subdirectories.
The idea is to have simpler relative paths, for example, e.g.:

.. code:: rst

   .. image:: ad2234_sdz_schematic.svg


Instead of over complicated paths like:

.. code:: rst

   .. image:: ../../project/images/ad2234_sdz/ad2234_sdz_schematic.svg

In general, this avoids dangling artifacts and keeps the documentation simple.

.. _git-lfs:

Git Large File Storage
----------------------

Where applicable, Git Large File Storage (LFS) is used to replace large files
with text pointers inside Git, reducing cloning time.

To setup, install from your package manager and init:

.. code:: bash

   apt install git-lfs
   git lfs install --skip-smudge

The files that will use Git LFS are tracked at ``.gitattributes``, to add new
files use a pattern at the repo root, for example:

.. code:: bash

   git lfs track *.jpg

Or edit ``.gitattributes`` directly.

Adding directives and roles
---------------------------

Sphinx allows to expand functionality beyond the defaults directives and roles
by loading extensions.

Doctools extended directives and roles are documented at:

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   directives
   roles

.. _extension-third-party:

Third-party directives and roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Repositories have the freedom to choose the third-party extensions they want to
include in their documentation.
They are listed on the *requirements.tst* file, and are installed with:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

The recommendation is to avoid using extensions that render content on the
client side using JavaScript, because it requires:

* fetching third-party scripts at someone-else server most of the times; and
* makes exporting to other formats (like pdf) harder, because it is then necessary to
  patch and replace with another non-JavaScript renderer.

.. _extension-repository:

Repository-specific extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extensions with repository-specific functionalities can be added to the repository
source code.

At *conf.py*, add:

.. code:: python

   import os
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join('.', 'ext'))

   extensions = [
        ...
        "ext_repo_name"
   ]

Create the *ext/ext_repo_name.py* and implement your custom directives/roles.
Replace *repo_name* with your repository name.

.. tip::

   If you think your extension could be useful for other repositories, consider
   migrating it to Doctools source code.

If the extension relies on files at the repository (like XML files), and/or
uses either env.found_docs or docnames to manage cache,
check if ``env.config.monolithic`` exists and is true.

If yes, prefix:

* the path to files with the relative path from the custom doc to the
  repository (always `../<repository>` (e.g.,`../hdl`)); and
* doc-names with the repository name (e.g., `hdl/`).

This ensures compatibility with :ref:`custom-doc`.

Here is a practical example:

* Metadata to be parsed is at ``repo_name/builds/info.xml``
* The sphinx source dir ``env.srcdir`` values are:

 * original doc (per repo): ``repo_name/doc/sphinx/source``
 * custom doc (always): ``_build``.

So, if is necessary to check ``env.config.monolithic`` to correct infer the
target file path, for example:

.. code:: python

   if hasattr(env.config, 'monolithic') and env.config.monolithic:
        repo_path = path.join(env.srcdir, '..', 'repo_name')
   else:
        repo_path = path.join(env.srcdir, '..', '..', '..')

   artifact_path = path.abspath(path.join(repo_root, 'builds', 'info.xml'))

This is necessary because Sphinx has no way of knowing the repository root
(without invoking a git shell), so hard-coding a relative path is necessary.

.. note::

   If the extensions is reused by multiple repositories, infeer the repository
   name from the first level (``my_repo/``) of the docname
   (``my_repo/tutorial/index``).

Custom doc copies
``env.srcdir(original)`` to ``env.srcdir(custom)/repo_name``
to avoid page conflicts when aggregating.
So, sometimes it is necessary to prefix docnames with the repository name:

.. code:: python

   if hasattr(env.config, 'monolithic') and env.config.monolithic:
        prefix = "repo_name"
   else:
        prefix = "."

   _somedoc = path.join(prefix, _somedoc)

For intermediary files, for example a SQLite database, it is recommended
to anchor to ``outdir/../managed``:

.. code:: python

   dest_dir = path.abspath(path.join(env.app.builder.outdir, pardir, 'managed'))
   sql_path = (dest_dir, "my_repo.sqlite")

Common sections
---------------

HDL common sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **More information** and **Support** sections that are present in
the HDL project documentation, are actually separate pages inserted as links.
They're located at *hdl/projects/common/more_information.rst* and */support.rst*,
and cannot be referenced here because they don't have an ID at the beginning
of the page, so not to have warnings when the documentation is rendered that
they're not included in any toctree.

They are inserted like this:

.. code-block::

   .. include:: ../common/more_information.rst

   .. include:: ../common/support.rst

And will be rendered as sections of the page.

Dynamic elements
----------------

Dynamic elements refer to sections of the documentation that are updated using
dynamically loaded metadata, scripts, and styles (modules).

The dynamic elements implemented:

* ``doctools/metadata.json``:

   - The navigation bar at the top (``repotoc`` entry).
   - A banner at the top (``banner`` entry).

The metadata/modules files are generated when ``core_repo`` is true in the
``conf.py``.
From the JavaScript side, it fetches first
``{content_root}[../versioned]/../doctools/[versioned]/metadata.json``,
which contains the basic metadata and the list of the extra scripts and styles.

.. note::

   path ``version`` is present and set if ``latest`` exists at
   ``{content_root}/../doctools`` and the stored version can be extracted.

.. tip::

   To keep the documentation lean, the metadata file is cached on localStorage
   and is only fetched again after the threshold time expires.

To add new JavaScript modules and CSS styles:

* Update :git-doctools:`ci/rollup.config.app.mjs`.
* Add the list of modules to :git-doctools:`adi_doctools/lut.py`.

The rollup should always output to the ``static`` directory, the same as the
base ``app.umd.js`` and ``app.min.css``.

Example use cases/suggestions:

* An ever improving ``search.umd.js``, that follows the natural evolution of the doc (in progress).
* A unified footer across releases, using DOM manipulation by a ``footer.umd.js``.

Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* On Firefox on Windows, fetch requests can only happen to the same port (8000 -> 8000),
  so :ref:`serve` daemon must be on port 8000
