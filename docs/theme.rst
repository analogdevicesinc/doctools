Sphinx theme
===============================================================================

A Sphinx themed called *harmonic* (old *cosmic*) is available.
It is deeply based on ADI's *harmonic* design language.

Shortcuts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

   Depending on your browser and operation system shortcuts, not all shortcuts
   may work or they may collide with existing ones, therefore, multiple are
   provided.

``Alt+Shift+ArrowLeft`` goes to the previous page and ``Alt+Shift+ArrowRight``
to the next page.
Alternatively ``Alt+Shift+A`` and ``Alt+Shift+D``.
``Ctrl+Alt+Shift+ArrowLeft/Right`` preserves the current page anchor, for example,
if the current section is *project_0.html#details*, ``Ctrl+Alt+Shift+ArrowRight``
goes to *project_1.html#details*, even if *details* does not exist
(same for ``A`` and ``D`` variants.
This feature is useful for batch reviewing sections common to multiple pages,
e.g. "Supported Devices".

The ``/``, ``Ctrl+K``, ``Alt+K`` key triggers the search bar.
